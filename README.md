Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/photon-home/photon-home.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/photon-home.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

Note that if you use the admin plugin, a file with your configuration, and named photon-home.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/` folder once the configuration is saved in the admin.


# blueprints

```sh
blueprints
└── home.yaml
```

- Home
    home.yaml
    extends: article
    fields:
   - home
